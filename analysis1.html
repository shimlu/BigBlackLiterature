                <h2>Text Summary</h2>
            <p>
                So basically The Prestige is this movie by Christopher Nolan about two magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, 
                who used to be friends but then became enemies after a magic trick went wrong and Angier's wife died. The whole 
                movie is about them trying to sabotage each others magic shows and basically destroy each other. It takes place 
                in London during like the late 1800s or early 1900s, when magic shows were really popular.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main conflict is that both magicians are obsessed with doing the perfect trick called "The Transported Man" where 
                you disappear in one place and appear in another place instantly. Borden figures it out first and Angier becomes 
                super obsessed with finding out how he does it. Theres also this inventor guy Tesla who Angier asks to help him, 
                and Tesla makes this machine that can clone things. The ending is pretty crazy because it turns out Borden was 
                actually twins the whole time living as one person, and Angier has been using the cloning machine but drowning 
                his clones every night to do the trick. Its a really dark movie about obsession and sacrifice.
            </p>

            <h3>Archetypal Analysis and Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
                When you look at The Prestige through an archetypal lens, theres alot of universal patterns and symbols that 
                Carl Jung talked about in his theories. Jung said that humans have this thing called the collective unconscious 
                which means we all share certain symbols and story patterns that appear in different cultures. The Prestige has 
                tons of these archetypal elements which makes it feel familiar even though the story is unique.
            </p>
            
            <h4>The Doppelganger and Shadow Archetype</h4>
            <p>
                The most obvious archetype in this movie is the doppelganger or the double. This archetype appears in like 
                every culture from Jekyll and Hyde to evil twins in folklore. In The Prestige, theres actually multiple 
                layers of doubles which is pretty clever. First, Angier and Borden are doubles of each other - they're both 
                magicians, both obsessed with the same trick, both willing to sacrifice everything. They mirror each other 
                throughout the whole film.
            </p>
            <p>
                But then theres the literal doubles too. Borden is actually two people (the Borden twins) pretending to be one 
                person, and Angier creates literal clones of himself with Tesla's machine. The doppelganger archetype usually 
                represents the dark side of ourselves or the parts we hide. For Borden, his "other half" is literally hidden
                one twin has to pretend to not exist. For Angier, his doubles are so dark that he literally murders them by 
                drowning them in a tank every single night. This shows how obsession can make you destroy yourself, which is 
                a pretty universal human experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Shadow archetype (another Jung thing) is also super important here. Each magician is the others shadow - 
                the dark reflection that brings out the worst in them. They push each other to do worse and worse things 
                because they cant accept that the other person might be better. This is like how in real life, the people 
                we hate the most sometimes reflect parts of ourselves we dont want to see.
            </p>
            
            <h4>The Quest and Obsession</h4>
            <p>
                Both characters are on a quest archetype which is one of the oldest story patterns ever. But instead of 
                questing for something good like the Holy Grail or treasure, theyre questing for the perfect illusion and 
                for revenge. The quest archetype usually involves a hero going on a journey and facing trials to achieve 
                something important. Angier literally travels to America to find Tesla, and both magicians go through tons 
                of trials (Angier loses his wife, Borden loses his fingers, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                But this quest is twisted because what theyre seeking isnt really worth it. The "treasure" at the end of 
                their quest is just more suffering and death. This subverts the normal quest archetype and shows how obsession 
                can corrupt even noble pursuits. The movie is basically saying that not all quests are heroic - some quests 
                destroy you and everyone around you.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Symbolic Archetypes</h4>
            <p>
                The movie uses alot of archetypal symbols too. The most obvious one is the light and darkness symbolism. 
                Magic shows happen in darkness with sudden bursts of light (when tricks are revealed). This represents the 
                duality of truth and illusion. Light usually symbolizes truth and knowledge in archetypal criticism, but in 
                this movie, the light is often the illusion while the darkness hides the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Water is another big archetypal symbol here. Water usually represents life, purification, or rebirth in 
                archetypal terms. But in The Prestige, water is associated with death Angier's wife drowns in the water 
                tank, and Angier drowns his clones in water tanks every night. This twisted use of the water archetype 
                shows how the characters have corrupted natural cycles of life and death.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bird cage trick at the beginning is also symbolic. Birds often represent the soul or freedom in archetypal 
                symbolism. When the bird gets crushed in the trick (and we find out later some birds die), it foreshadows how 
                both magicians will crush their own souls/humanity in pursuit of their goals. The bird in the cage represents 
                how they're both trapped by their obsession.
            </p>
            
            <h4>The Trickster Archetype</h4>
            <p>
                Both Angier and Borden embody the Trickster archetype in different ways. The Trickster is this archetypal figure 
                that appears in mythologies worldwide like Loki in Norse myths or Anansi in African folklore. Tricksters use 
                deception and illusion, they break rules, and they often blur the lines between good and evil.
            </p>
            <p>
                As magicians, both characters are literally professional tricksters. But they take the trickster role too far. 
                The trickster archetype is supposed to challenge society and reveal truths through deception, but Angier and 
                Borden just use their tricks to hurt each other. They've become dark versions of the trickster who use illusion 
                not to enlighten but to destroy. This shows how archetypal roles can be perverted when people lose their moral 
                compass.
            </p>

            <h3>Critical Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
                What makes The Prestige so powerful is how it takes these universal archetypal patterns and shows their dark side. 
                We're used to seeing the quest archetype in heroes like Frodo or Harry Potter, who quest for good reasons and grow 
                as people. But Angier and Borden show what happens when the quest becomes an obsession. They follow the same pattern 
                as heroic questers they face trials, they sacrifice things, they persist despite obstacles - but their journey leads 
                to destruction instead of enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The doppelganger/double archetype in the movie reveals something deep about human nature - that we're often divided 
                against ourselves. The Borden twins literally have to split one life between them, each giving up half their existence. 
                Angier has to kill versions of himself every night. This is like an extreme metaphor for how people sacrifice parts of 
                themselves for success or recognition. How many people kill their "true self" to present a perfect image to the world? 
                The movie makes this abstract idea concrete through literal doubles.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think what Nolan is doing with these archetypes is showing that the same patterns that make heroes can also make 
                villains. Its all about intention and balance. The archetypal patterns are neutral - they're just story shapes that 
                humans naturally create and recognize. But the characters in The Prestige take these patterns to their extreme and 
                dark conclusion. They're so busy being the hero of their own story that they dont realize they've become the villain.
            </p>
            <p>
                The movie also explores the archetype of the mask or the false self. Both magicians literally wear masks (disguises) 
                but they also metaphorically wear masks all the time. Borden pretends to be one person, Angier pretends to be a 
                lord, everyone is pretending to be something theyre not. This relates to Jung's concept of the persona the mask 
                we show the world versus our true self. The tragedy is that both magicians become so committed to their masks that 
                they lose touch with any authentic self underneath. The mask becomes the reality.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Analyzing The Prestige through archetypal criticism was really eye-opening for me because I didnt realize how many 
                universal patterns were packed into this one movie. Before I just thought it was a cool mystery about magicians, but 
                now I can see how Nolan is using story patterns that humans have been telling for thousands of years. The fact that 
                these archetypes appear in so many different cultures and time periods suggests that theres something fundamentally 
                human about them - they tap into experiences and fears that everyone can relate to.
            </p>
            <p>
                What surprised me most was how the movie subverts positive archetypes (like the quest) and makes them dark. It made 
                me think about how the same psychological patterns can lead to different outcomes depending on the persons values and 
                choices. The movie basically says that having ambition and dedication isnt enough you also need wisdom and restraint, 
                otherwise youll end up like Angier and Borden, destroying yourself and others. This lens helped me see that The 
                Prestige isnt just about magic tricks, its about the universal human tendency toward obsession and self-destruction 
                when we lose sight of what really matters.
