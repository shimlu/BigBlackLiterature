                <h2>How My Understanding of Literature Has Changed</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning of this course I basically just read for plot and picked out themes and appreciated good writing. I thought literature was like a window into other worlds which was cool for entertainment and maybe learning some moral lessons. I was pretty passive about it honestly. I just took whatever meaning the author seemed to be saying and didnt really question my own assumptions about how I was reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course completely changed how I think about literature. Now I understand that texts dont have one fixed meaning sitting there waiting to be found. Theyre complicated cultural things that can mean different things depending on what lens youre using to analyze them. The same story can reveal gender problems through a feminist lens, show psychological patterns through psychoanalytic lens, or demonstrate brilliant writing technique through formalism. Its wild how much is packed into a single text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another big thing I learned is that theres no such thing as neutral or objective interpretation. How I read something is shaped by my own culture, generation, experiences, and what theoretical approach im using. This actually made me more humble about saying "this is definitely what it means" but also more confident about explaining and defending my interpretations. Instead of asking "what does this mean" its better to ask "what meanings can this generate from different perspectives and what does that reveal."
            </p>
            <p>
                Probably the most important realization is that literature isnt escapism. Its actually deeply engaged with the biggest questions of human existence. Even texts from thousands of years ago or completely different cultures deal with stuff that still matters today like power, justice, love, loss, identity, mortality, meaning. Great literature doesnt give you answers though. It creates space to explore questions that dont have easy answers. This made me appreciate ambiguity more instead of wanting everything to be clear and resolved.
            </p>

            <h3>The Different Lenses: What Was Hard and What Clicked</h3>
            <p>
                Each lens had its own challenges and taught me different things. Looking back at using all these different approaches was probably one of the most valuable parts of the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Formalism was definitely the hardest for me.</strong> At first I found it super frustrating because you can only focus on the text itself like structure, imagery, language, form. I kept wanting to talk about historical context or the authors life or what the story says about society but formalism doesnt let you do that. Analyzing A Rose for Emily without talking about Southern history or Faulkner felt really artificial and constraining.
            </p>
            <p>
                But struggling with formalism actually taught me to read way more carefully. I learned to notice how structure creates meaning, how point of view affects everything, how imagery patterns build up themes, and how the language itself matters beyond just what its saying. Formalism trained me to see texts as carefully crafted objects where every choice the author made matters. Now I notice formal elements even when im using other lenses. So even though it was challenging, it actually expanded what I can see in texts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Queer theory was the most insightful for me.</strong> Using it to analyze Iphis and Ianthe really opened my eyes to how much gender and sexuality categories shape and limit what humans can do and be. Queer theory made me question assumptions about gender and sexuality that I thought were just natural truths but theyre actually social constructions that change throughout history. The myth showed ancient attitudes toward gender variance and same sex love but also connected to contemporary struggles.
            </p>
            <p>
                What made queer theory especially powerful is that it doesnt just say "include more identities in the existing system." It questions the system itself. Like why do we organize everything into binary gender categories? Why do we assume straight is the default? What possibilities get shut down by these assumptions? This critical approach to categories has influenced how I analyze everything now. I pay more attention to what gets included, excluded, and made invisible by cultural systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The other lenses taught me alot too.</strong> Feminist criticism helped me see power dynamics I totally missed before and showed how patriarchal structures shape everything. Psychoanalytic criticism revealed how literature expresses unconscious conflicts which made me appreciate symbolic and fantastical elements more. Archetypal criticism connected individual stories to universal patterns showing literatures roots in collective human experience. Reader response criticism validated that my interpretation matters while making me aware of how my own position shapes what I see.
            </p>

            <h3>How Great Books Changed My Thinking and Values</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond just learning how to analyze literature, this course has actually changed how I think and what I value. Reading texts from different cultures and time periods made me aware of both how different cultures are and how much humans have in common. I learned that my own cultural assumptions arent universal truths, theyre just particular to my context. But I also discovered that humans everywhere share fundamental concerns and experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>This course made me more empathetic.</strong> Literature lets you see through someone elses eyes and feel what they feel and think how they think. Reading about Psyches quest, Emilys isolation, Iphis's gender struggle, and the animal wisdom in Panchatantra expanded my ability to understand experiences I havent lived myself. This empathy isnt just emotional, its intellectual and moral too. It helps me recognize other peoples full humanity and take seriously worldviews that are different from mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The course strengthened my critical thinking and made me more humble.</strong> Learning multiple lenses taught me that truth often depends on your perspective. What you see depends on where youre standing and what questions youre asking. This could make you think either all interpretations are equally valid or no interpretation is valid, but for me it just made me more humble while still being rigorous. I think we should defend our interpretations but stay open to other perspectives that might show us what we missed. Good interpretation needs both conviction and flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>I learned to appreciate ambiguity and complexity more.</strong> The texts we studied rarely had simple moral lessons or clear meanings. Emily Grierson is both victim and villain, both sympathetic and horrifying. Cupid and Psyche both celebrates female agency and constrains it. Iphis's story hints at queer possibilities but resolves them in heteronormative ways. Instead of finding this frustrating I learned to value it. Real life is messy and contradictory and ambiguous. Literature that reflects this complexity engages with reality better than stories that pretend everything is simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Maybe most importantly this course showed me literatures power to challenge dominant narratives and imagine alternatives.</strong> Texts can reinforce existing power structures but they can also critique them and envision different possibilities. Reading critically with awareness of what texts include and exclude, whose perspectives they privilege and marginalize empowers us to resist oppressive narratives and imagine better worlds. If stories shape how we understand ourselves and the world then engaging critically with stories is crucial for making society better.
            </p>

            <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
            <p>
                Now that this course is ending I feel like I have more than just knowledge of specific texts and theories. My whole relationship with literature and interpretation has changed. I approach texts with more sophistication now, recognizing their complexity and all the different meanings they can have. I read with awareness of my own position and how it affects my interpretation. I appreciate literatures power to challenge me, console me, disturb me, and transform me.
            </p>
            <p>
                More than just literary analysis this course gave me critical thinking skills I can use anywhere. The ability to examine assumptions, consider multiple perspectives, recognize power dynamics, pay attention to symbolic meanings, and construct solid arguments these are valuable in any field and essential for being an engaged citizen in our complex world. Great Books taught me not just how to read literature but how to read the world critically, empathetically, and imaginatively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Im grateful for this journey and excited to keep applying these lenses to new texts and contexts and questions. The way of thinking this course developed in me (questioning, analyzing, connecting, interpreting) will be useful throughout my life as I keep reading and learning and growing.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                This Great Books course has honestly been transformative. It reshaped how I understand literature, interpretation, and the relationship between texts and human experience. I learned that great literature lasts because it addresses fundamental human questions with complexity and ambiguity and artistry that rewards deep engagement. I developed analytical skills and theoretical knowledge but also cultivated intellectual virtues like humility, empathy, critical awareness, and appreciation for complexity that go beyond just academics. As I move forward I carry these lessons with me, committed to reading thoughtfully, thinking critically, and engaging meaningfully with the stories that shape our world.
