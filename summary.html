                <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                So this semester I read alot of different stories from all over the place and different time periods too. We had ancient myths, short stories from America, wisdom books from India, and other stuff. What was cool is that we didnt just read them normally, we had to analyze them using these different critical lenses which I didnt really understand at first but now I kinda get it. Looking back at all the analyses I did, I can see patterns and themes that keep showing up which is pretty interesting because it shows that humans have been dealing with the same stuff forever basically.
            </p>

            <h3>Universal Human Experiences</h3>
            <p>
                One thing that really surprised me is how much the same themes show up in stories from completely different times and places. Like whether im reading ancient Greek myths or a short story from 1930s America or a fable from India, theres these patterns that keep repeating. I guess humans have always dealt with the same basic problems no matter where or when they lived.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Love and desire</strong> is literally everywhere in these stories. Every single text I analyzed had some form of love in it. Cupid and Psyche is about romantic love, A Rose for Emily is about this really messed up possessive love where she kills the guy she loves, Iphis and Ianthe shows genuine love between two people who society says shouldnt be together, and the Filipino folk tale has family love between siblings. What I learned is that love isnt just one thing. It can be romantic or family related or obsessive or transformative. But its always a huge motivator for what people do.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Identity and figuring out who you are</strong> is another big theme. So many characters are trying to understand themselves or struggling with their identity. Psyche has to go through all these trials to discover shes actually strong and capable. Iphis is dealing with gender identity which must have been super confusing in ancient Rome where they didnt have words for trans or nonbinary. Emily Grierson cant accept that the Old South is gone and she has to change with the times so she just isolates herself. These stories show that figuring out who you are is hard and sometimes painful but really important.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Death and trying to deal with mortality</strong> comes up alot too. Emily literally sleeps next to a dead body for years because she cant accept death. Psyche has to go to the underworld which is basically a death and rebirth journey. The Panchatantra stories often have life or death situations where characters have to be smart to survive. I think all these texts are exploring how humans cope with knowing we're gonna die someday. Some ways are healthy and some ways like Emilys are really not healthy at all.
            </p>

            <h3>Power, Gender, and Social Structures</h3>
            <p>
                Using feminist and queer theory to analyze these texts really opened my eyes to how much gender and power affect everything. Before this class I never thought that deeply about how gender roles are constructed by society instead of being natural. But now I can see it everywhere in these stories. Gender isnt just something you are, its something society enforces on you and it limits what you can do.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Cupid and Psyche I saw how the patriarchal system reduces women to their beauty and makes them compete with each other for mens attention. But Psyche also shows that women can be strong and capable even within those constraints. Iphis and Ianthe was even more intense because it shows how gender categories and heteronormative expectations literally cause suffering when you dont fit the mold. The crazy thing is these are ancient stories so gender variance and same sex love arent new at all. People have always existed outside the binary but society has always struggled with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Power works in alot of different ways in these texts. Sometimes its physical force, sometimes its social rules, sometimes its money and class, sometimes its just cultural ideas about how things should be. Emily has class privilege because shes from an old aristocratic family but shes still constrained by being a woman. Venus can make Psyche do impossible tasks because shes a goddess. In the Panchatantra the strong animals threaten the weak ones but sometimes the clever ones win anyway. What I learned is that power is complicated and works on multiple levels at once.
            </p>

            <h3>The Individual vs Society</h3>
            <p>
                Pretty much every story I read deals with this conflict between what you want as an individual versus what society expects from you. Its like this constant struggle between being yourself and fitting in with what everyone else thinks is normal or acceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emilys whole tragedy happens because she cant have what she wants in a way society approves of. She cant marry Homer Barron (probably because hes a northerner and lower class or maybe because hes not interested) so she just murders him and keeps his corpse. Thats obviously a really extreme and messed up solution. Iphis genuinely loves Ianthe but their love cant exist in society without the gods literally changing Iphis's body. Psyche has to complete these impossible tasks set by Venus (who basically represents society here) before shes allowed to love Cupid. The Panchatantra fables are constantly about balancing your own needs with what the group needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I dont think any of these stories say this tension can be fully resolved. Like we need social structures for things to work and for life to have meaning, but those same structures also constrain us and exclude people who dont fit. The stories acknowledge both sides without giving easy answers. They show that this is just something humans have to keep navigating forever basically.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Stories Matter</h3>
            <p>
                One thing this course taught me is that stories arent just for entertainment. They actually serve really important purposes psychologically and socially. The Panchatantra is obviously meant to teach lessons through stories about animals. Folk tales like Kulakog and Tilmag help cultures process psychological stuff and pass down values to the next generation. Myths like Cupid and Psyche or Iphis and Ianthe explore issues that society cant talk about directly, so they use symbolic stories instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Rose for Emily showed me that how you tell a story is just as important as what happens in the story. The whole power of that story comes from Faulkner jumping around in time and using the collective "we" narrator. My reader response analysis made me realize that meaning doesnt just sit there in the text waiting to be found. It gets created when a reader interacts with the text. So storytelling isnt just entertainment, its how humans make sense of life, pass on culture, work through trauma, imagine possibilities, and create meaning.
            </p>

            <h3>Big Takeaways</h3>
            <p>
                Here are the main things I learned from this course:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You can never fully exhaust a texts meaning:</strong> Using different lenses on the same story revealed completely different things. Like the same text that showed gender inequality through feminist lens showed universal psychological patterns through psychoanalytic lens. Great literature has multiple layers.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Where you come from affects how you read:</strong> My own background, culture, generation, experiences, all of that shapes how I interpret texts. Theres no such thing as a totally objective reading. Everyone brings their own perspective.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Literature can say things that regular speech cant:</strong> Through symbols and metaphors and story structure, literature explores truths about human experience that you cant capture with plain straightforward language.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Great books last because they deal with fundamental human questions:</strong> Even though the texts were from totally different times and places, they all engaged with the big questions like love, death, identity, power, meaning, and how to live a good life.</li>
                
                <li><strong>You need multiple perspectives to really understand something:</strong> No single lens shows you everything. You need to look at literature from different angles to get the full picture and avoid oversimplifying.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion: Why Great Books Matter</h3>
            <p>
                Looking at all these texts together, what really stands out is that humans everywhere throughout history deal with the same basic stuff. We all experience love and loss, try to figure out who we are, deal with power structures, face death, and struggle between what we want and what society expects. Great literature lets us explore these universal human experiences through specific stories that teach us general truths about life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also I learned that literature doesnt just reflect reality. It actually shapes how we understand ourselves and the world. These texts have influenced and still influence how societies think about gender, love, power, identity, and what makes life meaningful. Reading them critically helps us understand the stories and narratives that shape our culture. And maybe more importantly it lets us imagine alternatives and different possibilities for how things could be.
